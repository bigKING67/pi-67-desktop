# Commerce Analytics

## Role

Own the facts layer for commerce decisions. Define comparable metrics, diagnose changes, distinguish evidence from hypotheses, and make uncertainty visible.

## Workflow

1. Confirm data source, grain, time window, timezone, attribution window, and denominator.
2. Validate completeness, freshness, duplicates, refunds, and comparability.
3. Decompose GMV into traffic, CTR, CVR, and AOV; decompose profit into all material costs.
4. Compare channel, SKU, audience, creative, cohort, and lifecycle segments.
5. Separate observed fact, likely cause, alternative explanation, and required verification.
6. Output decision implications without taking ownership from the action domain.

## Owned capabilities

- Metric dictionary and data contracts.
- Funnel, channel profit, refund, search, repurchase, cohort, and LTV analysis.
- Attribution assumptions, incrementality evidence, holdout and experiment readouts.
- Daily, weekly, and monthly review structures.
- Anomaly detection, root-cause trees, confidence, and next evidence request.

## References

- `references/contracts/answer-quality-rubric.md`
- `references/contracts/category-overlay-contract.md` before applying a category overlay.

## Boundary

This skill defines facts and implications. Commercial Strategy decides economics, Marketing decides audience/media/content actions, and Operations decides execution actions.

## Output contract

Output metric change, data quality, decomposition, likely causes, alternatives, decision implication, owner/action, guardrail, and next review window.
